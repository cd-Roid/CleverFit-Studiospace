# CleverFit-Studiospace
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my gym implemented a way to check if the Studio is empty enough for people to train. As I am a lazy bum I do not want to always check i am fetching the needed data over their api and feeding them to my twitter feed over a twitter bot.


## Function
The bots send the amount of people in the Gym on an hourly basis.




### Tech: 
* CleverFit API
* Twitter API


## TODO:
* [X] Fix env issues. There seems to be a problem with the .env not being read. Probably a formatting error but ill have to check that out.
* [X]  Parse and filter the the api data.
* [X] Implement twittter DM. Twilios isnt working that well
* [X] Implement a function that sends a tweet hourly.
* [X] Implement function to Format the messages to look more pleasing.
